Problem statement:-
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a company that specializes in high quality bikes and cycling accessories. Their marketing department is evaluating offered data in order to raise business sales. The goal is to analyze and view the trends in the three datasets provided and then recommend 1000 high-value customers from a list to be targeted to drive the most value for the organization.

Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment:-
In this task, the client asked to assess the quality of their data and make recommendations on how to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.

In the given three datasets, I discovered numerous data quality issues and cleaned them up, as well as suggesting ways to minimize the issues for further analysis. Lastly, I drafted an email to the client that included all of the above information. All of the files are in the Task 1 folder.

Task 2 - Data Insights:-
In this task, the client asked to recommend which of these 1000 customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. The proposed strategy was broken down into three stages: Data Exploration, Model Development and Interpretation.

I merged all the three datasets into one. I did some Data Exploration on various field to gain some insights i.e gender, age groups, industry etc. For Model Development, RFM Analysis was used to perform customer segmentation to target the high value customers to boost the business growth. Finally, I created a complete Microsoft Power Point presentation that included all of the material mentioned above. All of the files are in the Task 2 folder.

Task 3 - Data Presentation:-
In this task, I used Tableau to develop a detailed interactive dashboard for gaining insights from datasets. [Click here to check the Tableau Viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.satapathy/viz/SprocketCentralDashboard-ForageInternship/SprocketCentralDashboard)
